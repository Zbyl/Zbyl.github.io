## Rules

Each player can plant plants, but only:
- on his start field (in the corner),
- on fields adjacent to his other plants.

Player uses seeds to plant plants.  
Seeds are given to each player periodically.  
Player can have a maximum of 5 seeds in his inventory.  

Pest can be used by players in predefined time intervals.


### Plants

| Plant     | Description                                                                               |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Grass     | When planted grows on it's own to neighboring fields (up to a certain radius).            |
| Dandelion | When planted spaws seeds nearby.                                                          |
| Mushroom  | When planted destroys neighboring plants (except Trees).                                  |
| Tree      | Does nothing, but cannot be destroyed.                                                    |
| Pest      | Runs on the map destroying everything he touches (Except Trees), and explodes at the end. |

### Goal

Plant as many plants as possible.  
The player with the most plants when the time runs out wins.

### Kids mode

Kids mode can be turned on in menu.  
When on, there is no seeds and pests limit, and planting plants is possible everywhere (except on other plants).
